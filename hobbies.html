                There are many things in my life that I truly love to do in my free time. Mainly,
                I spend this time hanging out or doing fun things with my friends. Watching/go to sports, 
                going out to dinner, or playing video games, there are very dull moments and I am lucky to have 
                them. I love listening to music, especially classic rock, throughout the day. From the Beatles,
                to Green Day, and above all Bruce Springsteen, I really enjoying listening to true music that
                makes me feel some type of way. My Mom sat me in the car when I was a kid and put on various
                classic rock stations birthing my love for this music. She taught me about  God himself, Bruce Springsteen,
                and I have been an insane fan forever. Going to his concerts with my family are some of the best times of my life.

                In addition, I watch a lot of movies of all kinds in my free time. From action to comedy to sci-fi,
                movies have always been an amazing way for me to learn something new and do so by watching with my family and 
                friends. Like my love of classic rock music, my parents always loved to watch movies so therefore I did too! My favorite 
                movie is <em>Field of Dreams</em> for its connection between baseball, fantasy, and a father/son relationship. The line
                at the end of the movie where the main character Ray asks his Dad to have a catch after years of not seeing each other always
                gets to me. As well, the Marvel franchise is my favorite and I have seen every single movie multiple times.
