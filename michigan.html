                    Ever since the moment that I was born, I was destined to become a Michigan
                    Wolverine. My parents instilled into me early the love for their alma mater, 
                    where they met as freshmen then graduated together in 1989. I had the motivation
                    early one throughout my childhood that there was no college for me other than Michigan.
                    Thanks especially to my Dad's infatuation of the school and their atheltic teams, mainly
                    football, I followed his lead in becoming the most avid Michigan fanatic in the world. 
                    Dating back to my first visit to Ann Arbor in 2007, I fell in love with everything about
                    the school from walking around State Street and through the Diag to South University. I 
                    admired the traditions, notably chanting <em>Hail to the Victors!</em> in the 
                    Big House with over 100,000 fellow Wolverines, and listening to inspirational Bo Schembechler
                    speeches. Though, I unfortunately didn't learn soon enough about the dangers of stepping on the big M in the diag, as seen here.

                From countless trips as a kid to the Big House for big games, to traveling to Atlanta for the
                Final Four, and various other schools to watch the Maize and Blue compete, I cared about nothing 
                as much as I did Michigan sports. Having the unique opportunity to meet Michigan Legends such as Desmond Howard, 
                John Beilein, Juwan Howard, and Trey Burke, I was blown away to be in the presence of god-like figures. 
                I have clear memories of devastation after many gutwrenching losses and thinking it was the end of the world, 
                nothing else mattered. It all just proves how much I love this University. I was, and will always be, a true Wolverine. 
                When it came time to go through my own college application process, it was obvious the way I was leaning. I will never 
                forget the feeling in the moment that December when I read the word "Congratulations", and I was officially a part of 
                the Leaders and the Best.
