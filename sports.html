                My true passion for sports has molded me into the person I am today. Sports have
                given me amazing opportunities throughout my childhood and now by bonding with others
                when watching sports, playing sports, or rooting for our favorite teams. As a young boy,
                I wasn't the most atheltic and skilled player out on the field/court, but my Dad would 
                spend hours with me at whichever sport I was playing at the time to improve and give myself
                more confidence. Whether it was my true favorite of baseball, or basketball, or lacrosse, I learned
                about working hard to put effort in so that I can reach my potential. That work ethic I grew to have 
                also found its way into my academic life. As I got older and played various sports, there was
                one main one that stood out to me above the rest: baseball. Starting in Little League and 
                playing until I was a starting pitcher on my high school's varsity team, baseball is everything to me.
                I was born to be a pitcher, and there hasn't been another activity that I was more infatuated with
                than pitching in a baseball game.

                On top of my true beloved Michigan Wolverines, I am an avid Mets, Jets, and Islanders fan. Passed down 
                from my Dad to me and his Dad to him, the love (and sometimes hate) for our favorite teams takes up our
                lives during the seasons they play. I have extremely fond memories of standing out in the gorgeous son
                to spend the afternoon watching a game with people I love. It has always been a much needed escape from 
                reality for a few hours that I continue to enjoy. Being able to sit and talk sports with anyone
                is one of my true favorite things to do, and I feel like I can for hours in a sitting.
